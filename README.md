# Scripts

A random assortment of scripts. Good enough to get the job done. Probably not much better than that.

## Quick Warning

Do not run any of this on your machine unless you read and understand the script. I will make all kinds of assumptions about my system (at the time of writing) that  will most likely not work on your system and they will most likley not work on a future setup of mine.
